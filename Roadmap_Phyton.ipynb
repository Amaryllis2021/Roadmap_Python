Linked lists are less rigid in their storage structure and elements are usually not stored in contiguous locations, hence they need to be stored with additional tags giving a reference to the next element. This difference in the data storage scheme decides which data structure would be more suitable for a given situation. Write a script explaining step by step this statement.\n",

        "\n",
        "4. Use the search() method: Once you have compiled the pattern, you can use the search() method to find all the instances of the pattern in the text. For example, let's say you have a string text = 'Apple is a fruit. Avocado is also a fruit.'. To search for all the words starting with 'A', you can use the following code: matches = regex.search(text).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Extract the matching text: After the search is complete, you can extract the matching text using the group() method. For example, the following code will print all the words starting with 'A': for match in matches: print(match.group())\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Use other RegEx functions: In addition to the search() method, the re module provides several other functions such as findall(), sub(), and split() to help you work with regular expressions."
